            <p class="lead">In this lesson, I learned about git. Git is used to track changes in a computer file for the purpose of coordinating work from those files with multiple people, and it is described as a version control system.  Git is very useful because of this functionality. There are many different commands to use with git that each effect the files in some different way. For example, you are able to view all of your new and changed files to be committed using git status. There are plenty of other commands to use and I look forward to getting to learn about them.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems are extremely useful to web designers and developers. They record changes to a file or set of files so that you can keep track of different versions over time. For example, if you wanted to keep every version of an image you would use a Version Control System. According to lesson 3, Version control systems also keep track of when a change was made, what kind of changes were made, and allows the developer to have the option to go back to a previous version of the file whenever it is necessary. A VCS is obviously important to become familiar with.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Different Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Like I said in the previous highlight, there are many different git commands that a developer could use to effect files and such. Im still fairly new on this, but there are a couple that I have learned about that I have gotten a bit familiar with.The git command that you would use if you wanted to records file snapshots permanently in version history is git commit -m "[descriptive message]". Another useful command to know is git push, which when used will upload all local branch commits to the remote repository. Git status is used to view all modified files to be committed.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is the site that I had to use to complete this homework assignment. I had to create an account online and link it to my Cloud9 account as well. GitHub is the largest host for Git repositories. GitHub is extremely useful for web developers around the world. It is the place where millions of developers and projects are able to converge. It is not a direct part of Git, however, so that is something to keep in mind. The command git clone will allow a user to get a copy of an already made Git repository. A web developer would find this command useful if there was a project that they needed to contribute to.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">How Git is Different</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This lesson has placed a big focus on Git, making sure that I understand the fundamentals of it, and what makes it stand apart from other VCS. It is explained through the chapter that other systems store information in a list of file-based changes. Git doesnâ€™t behave this way, however. Git takes the filesystem and composes the data into a series of snapshots. Every time you save the state of your project, Git will take a photo of what all of your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that picture. Also, another thing to know about Git, most of the time, it only needs local files to operate. </p>
