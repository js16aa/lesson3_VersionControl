## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (In this lesson, I learned about Git. Git is used to track changes in a computer file for the purpose of coordinating work from those files with multiple people, and it is described as a version control system.)
2. (Version control systems are extremely useful to web designers and developers. They record changes to a file or set of files so that you can keep track of different versions over time.)
3. (GitHub is the site that I had to use to complete this homework assignment. I had to create an account online and link it to my Cloud9 account as well. GitHub is the largest host for Git repositories.)
